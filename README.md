# Application Security Assignment 2
This blog web app is known as the Bikini Bottom blog used by spongebob characters. It allows for creating users and users can post onto the blog. The web app is vulnerable against CSRF attacks because it uses a really weak non-random secret key which is 'key' and has weak authentication. All that is need is the correct email and password of the user to login and and there are unlimited attempts to log in. In addition, the database stores the passwords unhashed. This means the passwords are in plaintext in the database so if someone gains access to the database, they can see all of the users and their passwords.
